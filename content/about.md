# :wave: Hi.

Welcome to my personal site. I use this site to present my abridged CV and also store technical guides for my own easy access. If it helps others, all the better! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!

# :japanese_ogre: Who am I?

I am a Free Software enthusiast and IT professional - originally from the USA, living and working in beautiful Budapest, Hungary. Did I mention that I'm passionate about Free Software?

My actual degree is an Associate's in Electronic Communications Technology (basically a radio technician) from Los Angeles Trade Technical College, but most of my work has been in IT, and over the years, that's the area I feel most at home.  

# :briefcase: Some places I've worked...

**Broadcast Exchange** - Junior Partner  
*2010 - 2015*  
Family business. In my time working here I managed our brand and marketing assets, built a website with ecommerce integration, and of course managed and listed our inventory of used Audio / Video equipment for sale both on our own site and on eBay.

**Alphanet Informatics** - IT Operations Adviser  
*2017 - 2019*  
Managing Wordpress and Moodle for customers, managing the company's own CMS and creating web and print marketing content in tandem with our corporate partners.

**Bitrise** - Technical Support Engineer  
*2019 - 2020*  
My short but sweet foray into the startup world - helping Bitrise users build, troubleshoot, and manage their CI pipelines. A great chance to use a variety of soft and hard skills!

**Deutsche Telekom IT Solutions** - Application Administrator  
*2020 -*  
Managing Openshift clusters on a handful of cloud solutions, including Telekom's own Open Telekom Cloud.  

# :computer: Non-exhaustive list of technologies I (have) work(ed) with:

* Kubernetes
* RedHat Openshift
* OCI-compliant container frameworks :package:
* RedHat toolset
* Ubuntu toolset
* BASH :moneybag:
* Python :snake:

# To sum up:
I love Free Software, I use Linux every day. For everything. I don't like MacOS or Windows, but I will use them for :dollar: if I **must**. (I actually know a thing or two about them as well.) My main hobby and career motivation is to learn more about the technologies I am interested in and to create and promote the use of Free Software.
